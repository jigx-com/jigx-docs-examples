# action-list

This action allows for multiple actions to be run while only requiring the user to press a single button. The actions can be set to run sequentially or executed as a bulk functionality.

### Configuration options

An `action list` can be set up in various ways:

1. As a primary action button.
2. In onPress/onChange events - usually triggered by [list](../Widgets/list.md) or [jig.list](<../Jig Types/jig_list.md>) related items.
3. In onRefresh/onFocus events on any type of jig.

### Examples and code snippets

#### Action-list as a primary action button

:::VerticalSplitItem This example shows an action-list with two actions. The first action is [submit-form](https://docs.jigx.com/examples/submit-form), which will save the entered data, and the second action, [go-back](https://docs.jigx.com/examples/go-back), will redirect us back to the previous page.

**Example:** See the full example of action-list in [GitHub](https://github.com/jigx-com/jigx-samples/blob/main/quickstart/jigx-samples/jigs/jigx-actions/action-list/action-list-primary.jigx) ::: ::::

:::VerticalSplitItem In this example, we have an action list with the onPress function in the list-item. The first action will color the last chosen item and the second action will sync our entity with the database and we can use them for further actions.

**Example:** See the full example of action-list in onPress in [GitHub](https://github.com/jigx-com/jigx-samples/blob/main/quickstart/jigx-samples/jigs/jigx-actions/action-list/action-list-onPress.jigx).

#### Action list as onRefresh/onFocus

In this example when we refresh the jig/jig is focused, we call set-state and sync-entities actions.

**Example:** See the full example of the action list onRefresh in [GitHub](https://github.com/jigx-com/jigx-samples/blob/main/quickstart/jigx-samples/jigs/jigx-actions/action-list/action-list-onRefresh.jigx). See the full example of the action list onFocus in [GitHub](https://github.com/jigx-com/jigx-samples/blob/main/quickstart/jigx-samples/jigs/jigx-actions/action-list/action-list-onFocus.jigx).
