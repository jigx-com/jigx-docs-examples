# Dynamic Files

Dynamic Files extend Jigx's Dynamic Data entities to include file references, allowing files to be securely stored and associated with entities. See [Dynamic files](https://docs.jigx.com/building-apps-with-jigx/data/data-providers/dynamic-files) to understand more.

The following examples with code snippets are provided in this section:

* [Upload a file](<Upload a file.md>)
* [Download a file](<Download a file.md>)
* [Delete a file](<Delete a file.md>)
* [Status of a file](<Status of a file.md>)
