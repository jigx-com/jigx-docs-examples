# Creating Dynamic Data

Creating Dynamic Data can be achieved in several ways, one of which is by using a form. In this example, we will demonstrate how to create a new employee form that will create the employee table, columns, and data record in the Dynamic Data database when the form is submitted.

## Data provider, jig, component & action

1. **default.jigx** is the database where the Dynamic Data table is defined.
2. [jig.default](<../../Jig Types/jig_default.md>) is the type of jig we will use to contain the form.
3. [form](../../Components/form/form.md) is the component used with text and date fields.
4. [submit-form](../../Actions/submit-form.md) is the action that executes the create method of the Dynamic Dataprovider

## Create the Dynamic Data table

{% columns %}
{% column %}
In Jigx Builder under the databases folder in the **default.jigx** file the employee table is added. This will create the table in Dynamic Data.
{% endcolumn %}

{% column %}
{% code title="default.jigx" %}
```yaml
tables:
  employee: null
```
{% endcode %}
{% endcolumn %}
{% endcolumns %}

## Create the jig, form and action

The code example below is for the `jig.default` with the `component.form` that uses `componet.text` and `component.date-picker` to create the fields on the form. The `action.submit-form` executes the `DATA_PROVIDER_DYNAMIC` that uses the `save/create` method to create columns and data records.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="new-employee-form.jigx" %}
{% code fullWidth="true" %}
```yaml

## View the Dynamic Data in Jigx Management

1. Open [Management](https://docs.jigx.com/management-overview) , navigate to your solution (employees).
2. Navigate to **Data** option
3. Click on the **employee table** and view the **data record** you just created.
