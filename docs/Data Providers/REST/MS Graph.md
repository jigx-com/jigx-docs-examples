The [MS Graph](https://docs.jigx.com/microsoft-graph-oauth) examples below use the User, Calendar, Mail, Insights, and To-do tasks resource types to create a powerful Jigx apps with everything you need in one app. The REST data provider requires you to [configure OAuth for MS Graph](https://docs.jigx.com/configuring-oauth-for-ms-graph) and the accessToken is used in the Jigx function.

When using the code and samples in this topic, remember that they are designed to function as part of a comprehensive solution. To fully benefit from the intended functionality and ensure compatibility, it is recommended that you use the entire solution rather than selecting individual components in isolation. Alternatively, you can use these samples as a guide to understand the underlying concepts and MS Graph API, which can help you integrate similar solutions into your projects more effectively. The entire MS Graph solution is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jigx-com/jigx-samples/tree/main/quickstart/jigx-MS-Graph-demonstrator).
