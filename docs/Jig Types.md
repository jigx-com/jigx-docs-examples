# Jig Types

Refer to the [Jigs (screens)](https://docs.jigx.com/jigs-screens) topic to understand concepts, use cases, and how to configure the various jig types. The topics in this section provide code examples for each jig type.

| **Types**   | **Use**                      | **Code Examples**                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Calendar    | Use this jigto build a calendar to display scheduled events and create new events based on a date and time.                                      | [jig.calendar](<./Jig Types/jig_calendar.md>)     |
| Composite   | This jig allows you to display multiple jigs on one screen where you would otherwise be unable to combine the functionality in the same way. For example, a form and list are on the same screen, where the form on completion populates the list with data.      | [jig.composite](<./Jig Types/jig_composite.md>)   |
| Default     | The default jig is the most versatile and provides the majority of functionality and a combination of different components and [actions](https://docs.jigx.com/actions). The most common use of a default jig is for forms and lists.                                                         | [jig.default](<./Jig Types/jig_default.md>)       |
| Document    | Used to show PDF files or HTML pages inside your app.                                                                                                      | [jig.document](<./Jig Types/jig_document.md>)     |
| Full-screen | Create a full screen to show a [location](./Components/location.md) across the entire screen.                                                               | [jig.fullscreen](<./Jig Types/jig_fullscreen.md>) |
| Grid        | Create grid layouts in your app, organizing content into rows and columns for a visually consistent and flexible interface. It helps align elements proportionally, ensuring a structured design.                                                                 | [jig.grid](<./Jig Types/jig_grid.md>)             |
| List        | Create lists of data and style these lists with elements such as [avatars](./Components/avatar.md), or [images](./Components/image.md). Make the list interactive by adding checkboxes and swipeable elements for updating or deleting the data in the list-item. | [jig.list](<./Jig Types/jig_list.md>)             |
| Table       | The table jig displays structured data in rows and columns, allowing users to view and interact with multiple records within the app.                        | [jig.table](<./Jig Types/jig_table.md>)           |
| Tabs        | Navigate between different jigs with ease, enhancing the user experience by providing an organized layout. These tabs are placed at the top of the screen to ensure a sleek and intuitive interface.                                                              | [jig.tabs](<./Jig Types/jig_tabs.md>)             |
