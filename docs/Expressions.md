# Expressions

An overview and explanation of using expressions in Jigx is provided in the [Expressions](https://docs.jigx.com/expressions) and [Advanced Expressions](https://docs.jigx.com/expressions#CEdVY) section in the Guide tab.

Refer to the [Expressions - cheatsheet](https://docs.jigx.com/expressions-cheatsheet) for code snippets that can help you achieve a required result, such as creating a placeholder in a jig.

In this section, examples with code snippets are provided for working with data using JSONata; these are:

| **JSONata**                                                         | **Example of use**                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Arrays](./Expressions/Arrays.md)                                   | Create filtered lists from arrays and handling arrays with SQL and Dynamic Data                                                                                                                         |
| [Aggregation](./Expressions/Aggregation.md)                         | To return the minimum, maximum, or average value in an array.                                     |
| [Boolean](./Expressions/Boolean.md)                                 | Evaluate data to find a true or false result.                                             |
| [Comparison Operators](<./Expressions/Comparison Operators.md>)     | Compare values in data and use the value in a conditional logical expression, e.g., is an amount greater than 100.                                                                                      |
| [Date & Time](<./Expressions/Date _ Time.md>)                       | Return a date and time in various formats, e.g., ISO 8601.                      |
| [Path Operators](<./Expressions/Path Operators.md>)                 | Navigate and access specific elements or properties within a data set, e.g., for filtering or searching.                                                                                                |
| [Functional Programming](<./Expressions/Functional Programming.md>) | Compare values or display data based on certain conditions and use logical statements, e.g., adding HTML variables in content or a multi-select as a `functionParameter`.                               |
| [Jigx Variables](<./Expressions/Jigx Variables.md>)                 | Jigx variable set used in expressions to manipulate data specific to a Jigx App, e.g., determining the logged-in user or the organization and solution.                                                 |
| [Predicate Queries](<./Expressions/Predicate Queries.md>)           | Used for query refinement.                                                                      |
| [String](./Expressions/String.md)                                   | String expressions have many uses, such as concatenating two strings to display multiple data records in one row, writing numbers as strings, or selecting only a few characters from the whole string. |
| [Advanced expressions](<./Expressions/Advanced expressions.md>)     | Advanced expressions are helpful when you need to filter an array of records to display specific data and perform expression transformations over the data.                                             |
| [Regex +JSONata](<./Expressions/Regex expressions.md>)              | Create validation for text fields by combining JSONata and Regex expressions.               |
| [JavaScript expressions](https://docs.jigx.com/examples/javascript-expressions)                                         | JavaScript functions allow you to write modular and reusable code, by encapsulating specific functionality within JavaScript functions and calling the function in an expression.                       |
