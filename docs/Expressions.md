# Expressions

An overview and explanation of using expressions in Jigx is provided in the [Expressions](#) and [Advanced Expressions](#) section in the Guide tab.

Refer to the [Expressions - cheatsheet](#) for code snippets that can help you achieve a required result, such as creating a placeholder in a jig.

In this section, examples with code snippets are provided for working with data using JSONata; these are:

| [Comparison Operators](<./Expressions/Comparison Operators.md>)     | Compare values in data and use the value in a conditional logical expression, e.g., is an amount greater than 100.                                                                                      |

| [Path Operators](<./Expressions/Path Operators.md>)                 | Navigate and access specific elements or properties within a data set, e.g., for filtering or searching.                                                                                                |
| [Functional Programming](<./Expressions/Functional Programming.md>) | Compare values or display data based on certain conditions and use logical statements, e.g., adding HTML variables in content or a multi-select as a `functionParameter`.                               |
| [Jigx Variables](<./Expressions/Jigx Variables.md>)                 | Jigx variable set used in expressions to manipulate data specific to a Jigx App, e.g., determining the logged-in user or the organization and solution.                                                 |

| [Advanced expressions](<./Expressions/Advanced expressions.md>)     | Advanced expressions are helpful when you need to filter an array of records to display specific data and perform expression transformations over the data.                                             |
