Our schema includes various properties that define the structure and characteristics of data entities. Each property is documented with its name, type, allowable values, and detailed description. This section ensures you have a clear understanding of how to use each property to successfully create a Jigx App.

We have included practical code examples to help you implement and integrate these properties, actions, and components. These examples demonstrate common use cases and best practices, helping you quickly get started and avoid common pitfalls.

The code examples are downloadable to guide your development process. The **jigx-samples** solution includes most examples featured in this documentation, offering a hands-on experience to understand how each feature and functionality works.

We provide three convenient options for accessing these resources, ensuring you have the flexibility to choose the method that best suits your needs. See [Setting up your solution](Overview/Setting%20up%20your%20solution.md) for more information.
